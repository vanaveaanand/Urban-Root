As technology continues to evolve, educational institutions and corporate training programs are increasingly adopting VR solutions to enhance the learning experience. The global VR in education market size was valued at approximately USD 3.0 billion in 2023 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 35% from 2024 to 2030. This growth is driven by increasing investments in VR hardware and software, as well as a growing demand for immersive learning experiences across K-12, higher education, and corporate training sectors.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>Several key factors contribute to the rapid growth of VR in education.

Furthermore, the rise of remote learning, accelerated by the global pandemic, has boosted the demand for VR as a tool to facilitate remote education with immersive and collaborative environments. The market is also benefiting from the growing accessibility and affordability of VR devices.
